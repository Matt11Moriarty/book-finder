# Book Finder

## Description

As an avid reader, I wanted a way to search for new books and save them so I can find them later. To accomplish this goal, I started with a fully functional book finder app that was built using MVC, and refactored the back-end to use Graphql and the MERN stack!

In building this application, I learned a ton about leveraging the MERN stack, but more importantly how to effectively refactor code. Going forward, I am much more confident in my ability to inherit legacy code, and refactor it to meet additional or modified requirements.
